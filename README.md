Block Party
===========

This is a Max patch by [@rconstanzo](https://github.com/rconstanzo).  This
repo should be considered [@rknLA](https://github.com/rknLA)'s fork of
the project, rather than its canonical home.

---

In Rodrigo's words, Block Party "is kind of a party van 1.5"

You can find the Party Van on Github [here](https://github.com/rconstanzo/the-party-van)

---

The Party Van thread on [lines](http://llllllll.co/t/app-the-party-van/247/291)
has more info about the Party Van, and the release zips of Block Party.

The first commit of this project is the [beta 5](http://llllllll.co/t/app-the-party-van/247/291)
posted there.

All subsequent commits are tweaks for @rknLA's setup.

## Externals

Github doesn't play nicely with committing the Mac versions of Max externals
(.mxo files), since they're actually packages / folders, rather than single
files.  As such, you should download the [beta 5 zip from the Party Van thread](http://llllllll.co/t/app-the-party-van/247/291)
and copy the externals over from there if you need to use git for development.
